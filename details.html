<h1>Our Wedding Details</h1>

<div id="details">
<h2>Friday, September 12, 2003, 3 PM</h2>

<p>The wedding will be held at <a href="http://bridalveillakes.com/">Bridal Veil Lakes</a>, Oregon, overlooking the Columbia Gorge.
</p>
<p>The ceremony will be held lake side, and will be immediately followed by a dinner reception on the opposite side of the lake. Some shelter is available in case of poor weather. Guests are encouraged to wear appropriate attire, as the roads are gravel, and some walking across grass lawns will be required (high heels should be avoided) - Imagine the ceremony being held in your backyard, and dress for that. Clean restrooms are available, for anyone who wants to change after driving.
</p>
<p>As most of you know, we love children, and any of you with children are encouraged to bring them along. There's plenty of room for blankets, playpens, toys, or anything else that may be needed to keep them entertained.
