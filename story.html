<h1>Our Story</h1>

<div id="bride">
<h2>Bride's Version</h2>
<p>I met Scott 5 yrs. Ago when I was 18 and about to leave home for my jr. year of college in Ellensburg. He had been a good friend of David's for two years, but we had never met because I was still at home in Milton going to community college and getting into trouble, and David was going to PSU in Portland. The night I met Scott was actually David's last night in Portland, and I drove down with a friend for his going away party. I had vaguely heard about this friend he had who lived in a box in his parents' basement, but that was all of my knowledge of Scott.</p>

<p>When Scott arrived at David's party I thought two things: 1. this guy had nice legs. 2. I was going to be involved with him somehow. The night we met is an entire story in itself because we spent the ENTIRE night talking…and I do mean the whole night. I got maybe an hours worth of sleep before I had to wake the other girls up at like 6 so we could drive home. (Incidently, this was the first time I found out Dave and Rose were dating.) we have been together ever since. We had an amazing, passionate long distance relationship for a year, and moved in together in Portland a year after we met. I did Americorps, and he finished his senior year at PSU, and then we moved to Ellensburg so I could finish college, but that didn't work out so we moved back to Portland after like 10 months. We were sort of in limbo that summer, living at our respective parents' houses, but visiting all the time….I even got to totally surprise him one morning, I let his parents know I was coming and drove to Portland and woke him up one morning, and stayed the weekend, it was awesome.</p>

<p>Anyway, then we moved in to the apt. we're in now, and the following August, on my birthday he proposed!  In a couple weeks it'll be our 5th year anniversary. I can hardly believe I've been with someone this long, but at the same time, I can't imagine not being with him. We've literally been together since the night we met, and even though of course life hasn't been perfect, I wouldn't have it any other way. In fact, the one thing we both marvel at is how we both had this feeling of relief when we met, like "oh there you are, I was only going to wait five more minutes." We both just felt like oh, duh, I'm supposed to be with you. It's never even been questioned that we're supposed to be together, because it wouldn't make any sense not to be.</p>

<p>I think we have an intensely passionate, trusting and comfortable relationship and I am so thrilled to be marrying him and into his wonderful family.</p>

<p>I LOVE SCOTT VANDEHEY!!!!</p>

<h2>Groom's Version</h2>
<p>The night that Annie and I met (at her brother's party), we watched Barbarella together. When I saw her laugh at all the same parts I did, I knew there was something to this girl. We sat together and talked and flirted all night long, and I floated home the next morning (where I got in a fight with my roommate). Before you know it, on most weekends either she was driving down to Portland, or I was catching a bus up to Tacoma. When we weren't visiting each other, we were amassing shockingly large long distance bills from calling each other every night. This pattern of behavior continued even after she moved to Ellensburg to go to college. I would hitch a (five hour) car ride with a guy who was dating one of her friends, to spend a weekend in her dorm room, and our long distance bills only got larger.</p>

<p>Eventually, all the commuting got the better of us, and Annie moved to Portland, where we shared a one-bedroom cinderblock apartment just off-campus. After about a year of that (and my graduation), we moved to Ellensburg together so she could finish college. Just short of a year later, we fled from Ellensburg, and returned to Portland, where we crashed with my parents for a couple months before we moved into the duplex where we live now.</p>

<p>As of June 26th, Annie and I will have been together for five years. We've explored the perils of co-habitation, and have experienced the full range of income from double-unemployment food-stamps-and-ramen poverty to dual-income fancy-japanese-ramen comfort. This year, we'll take that next step and upgrade from boyfriend and girlfriend to husband and wife.</p>

<p>Annie is my greatest ally and my evil super-villain. She is my load-bearing-wall and my decorative facade. If I had to choose only one person to be stranded on a desert island with, I would choose her because she would not only put up with me singing camp songs endlessly, she'd be singing them with me. Annie and I are passionate about many of the same things, but different enough from each other to never get bored. She's kept me fascinated for five years, and I'm looking forward to many, many more.</p>
